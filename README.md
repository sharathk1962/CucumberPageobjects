# CucumberPageobjects

I have automated the assigned task using Webdriver IO.

Have used Mocha framework and also have used Allure reports.

Have also creates multiple features files and Test scrips, also used chai- assertion concept for the validation.

One is creating account and validating the username once the user craeted, Second one is adding items to the cart and validatig the added item name.

Have also done all the setup required for the WebDriverIO framework from scratch by running different npm commands.

Note: Aware that few enhancent can be done for the same but have submitted working framework for now.
